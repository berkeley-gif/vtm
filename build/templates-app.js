    "		<h3>What is an \"Unmatched species code\"?</h3>\n" +
    "		<p>An \"Unmatched species code\" refers to a code that we haven't been able to associate with a species.  When the original VTM surveyors recorded their data, they used 1-3 letter codes to refer to different species.  They listed most of these codes and their corresponding species in the VTM field manual, or along with the original data sheets, but not all of them.  Sometimes they also recorded irregular codes, or made typos, neither of which match to a species given the listings in the manual.</p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "		<h3>What is an \"Ambiguous species code\"?</h3>\n" +
    "		<p>An \"Ambiguous species code\" refers to a code that could refer to multiple different species.  Sometimes the original surveyors used the same code to refer to different species when they were working in different places.  Several of the species code crosswalks they left behind are quad specific, so if a code means one thing in the Napa quad and another in the Placerville quad, we can distinguish them.  However, several ambiguous codes are not quad specific, so given an ambiguous code in an area where none of the quad-specific crosswalks apply, we just report all the species to which the code could refer.</p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "		<h3>What do you mean by \"<em>Probable</em> Species\"?</h3>\n" +
    "		<p>Given the above complications in translating the species codes to full species names, and the errors inherent in the original data and those contributed by modern data entry,  we don't consider all our translations to be completely accurate.  Next to each name, you should see a link that will pop up a window showing you all the code-to-species matches from the various translation tables included in the original VTM data.</p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "		<h3>How do you translate the species codes to actual species names?</h3>\n" +
    "		<p>The VTM data come with several lists of occasionally contradictory code-to-species translations, covering different areas of the state.</p>\n" +

    "        <p>In the 1930s, forester A. E. Wieslander spearheaded a U. S. Forest Service survey of California vegetation, called the Vegetation Type Mapping Project. Originally, the project was slated to include detailed vegetation type maps of 220 USGS quadrangles, but the survey was halted by World War II, and only 23 maps were published. The project continued after the war under state funding, but no more quads were published. However, much of the unpublished data survives today and exists in storage at the University of California, Berkeley, and at other map libraries and research labs around California. The VTM dataset has been recognized as an invaluable window into the state of California flora in the early 20th century, has provided data for several graduate theses at several Universities, and has been the focus of numerous journal articles. However, the dataset's physical fragility has made it largely inaccessible to the broader scientific community. Researchers at U. C. Berkeley Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management (ESPM), in conjunction with the Marian Koshland Bioscience and Natural Resources Library, sought funding to digitize all of the published and unpublished dataset, for use in modern geographic information systems and to facilitate its distribution via the Internet.</p>  \n" +
    "\n" +
    "        <p><blockquote>The Wieslander Vegetation Type Mapping collection has been described as &ldquo;the most important and comprehensive botanical map of a large area ever undertaken anywhere on the earth&rsquo;s surface&rdquo;.<small>Jepson et al. 2000</small></blockquote></p>         \n" +
    "\n" +
    "        <p>The ultimate goal of the original VTM project was to create vegetation type maps, but in the process the surveyors collected several other kinds of data as well. In order to validate some of the broad zones of vegetation they designated from high vantage points, the surveyors also ran vegetation transects, collecting data on species composition, depth of leaf litter, and tree size, among other things. They marked the location of these plots on USGS topographic maps, which today provide us with point occurrences of the individual species they found. Addtionally, they collected sample specimens and placed them in the University Herbarium (now the Jepson Herbarium), many of which remain there today. They also took photos of many vegetatively distinct locations, and marked the locations of these photos on maps (unfortunately most of these photos maps have been lost). And finally, of course, they created vegetation maps, drawing broad zones of single or mixed stands in crayon over USGS topographic quads.</p>\n" +

    "<div class=\"row\">\n" +
    "    <div class=\"col-sm-12\">\n" +
    "\n" +
    "		<p>The plot data consists of about 18,000 datasheets of recorded vegetation and environmental data from plots located throughout California and nearby areas of Nevada and Oregon.  Most plots were recorded in the 1930's and some as early as the 1920's.  Much of the data was collected in timberland since the objective of the VTM project was to survey forest resources (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/vtm/ucb/text/cubio_vtm_fm.pdf\">Manual of Field Instructions for Vegetation Type Map of California, pg.1</a>); however, plots were also located in non-timber forests and woodlands, shrublands, and grasslands.</p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "		<h3>A Brief Summary of the Methods</h3>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "		<p>The Brush and Ground Cover plots were 2 x 0.5 chains in size (132 x 33ft or roughly 40 x 10m). VTM field biologists divided the rectangular plot into 100 equal sections and recorded the one herb or shrub species that was dominant in each subplot. They then calculated percent cover for each species by summing the number of subplots containing each dominant species. They also recorded the average height of each species and the depth of the litter.</p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "		<p>Trees were sampled in a 1 chain wide strip whose center line coincided with one of the midline edges of the Brush and Ground Cover plot, thus Tree Tally plots were 2 x 1 chains in size (132 x 66ft or roughly 40 x 20m).  All trees with a DBH (diameter breast height) of at least 4\" were tallied by species into DBH size classes.</p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "		<p>In addition to herb, shrub, and tree data, they also recorded: vegetation type, exposure, slope, year of last burn, soil depth and character, parent rock, site index (an index of soil productivity measured by estimating the height attainable by the average dominant trees at 300 years), additional ground cover species, and remarks about the plot.  A complete description of the methods for the plot data can be viewed in the VTM field manual <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/vtm/ucb/text/cubio_vtm_fm.pdf\">Manual of Field Instructions for Vegetation Type Map of California</a>, by A.E. Wieslander.  VTM vegetation plots are referred to as \"Vegetation Type Sample Plots\" or just \"Sample Plots\" in VTM documents.</p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "		<h3>Naming Conventions</h3>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "		<p>Each VTM plot map was divided into a grid, labeled alphabetically down the side and numerically across the top. The plots were numbered within each section of the grid, for example A13 for grid section A 1, plot 3. We assign each plot a unique identifier by prepending the quad number, i.e. 65A13 for quad 65, grid section A 1, plot 3.</p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "		<h3>Entering the Data</h3>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "		<p>The plot datasheets were entered by the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nature.berkeley.edu/allen-diazlab/\">Allen-Diaz Lab</a> into an MS Access database developed by staff at the USDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, Forest Inventory and Analysis Program.  Each section on the datasheets corresponds to a field in the database.  The only field that does not occur on the datasheets is the Miscellaneous Notes field.  This field contains additional information about the datasheet that does not fall into one of the standard sections on the datasheet such as notes written on the margins, condition of the datasheet, or other noteworthy comments about the datasheet. </p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "		<h3>Quality Control</h3>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "		<p>The VTM plot collection is a large dataset that required over a thousand data entry hours to transform almost 18,000 handwritten datasheets from the 1930's into a usable format for the public.  Needless to say, this enormous task also involved countless hours of quality control to find and correct data entry errors. We report error rates from quality assurance (QA) tests that should help users gauge the usefulness of the data for their own purposes.</p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "		<p>To test the database for accuracy, we (the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nature.berkeley.edu/allen-diazlab/\">Allen-Diaz Lab</a>) randomly selected two non-overlapping samples of 100 plots from the collection and compared what was entered to what was written on the datasheets.  Each field in the database corresponds to a section on the datasheet.  We documented errors we found for each field so we could calculate a percent error per field.  Errors were counted if it resulted in an incorrect or missing value.  If what was written was slightly different than what was entered but did not change the meaning, it was not counted as an error.  For example, in the geographic location field, if \"1/2 mile\" was changed to \"0.5 mile\" it was not counted as an error.  Results from the QA tests are shown in the table below.</p>\n" +

Since that time many taxonomic changes have occurred along with the publications of the Munz manual (Munz and Keck 1968) and the second Jepson manual (Hickman 1993), among others.  It is important to understand that not all revisions are a straightforward replacement of the old name with the current name.  Taxonomic changes can also include lumping and splitting of taxa, changes in rank, and circumscription changes.  We did not update any of the names in the plot collection to current names.  We have provided a link in the <a target=\"_blank\" href ui-sref=\"data.plots\">plot data query tool</a> that provides historical synonyms, but users should be aware of the complexities of certain taxonomic changes and be judicious in their use. </p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "		<p>There are some especially troublesome species codes that may provide a challenge to users of the plot data.  Sometimes the same species code in the VTM species lists can code for two different species.  For example, one of the species lists shows A2 as the code for <i>Agrostis sp</i>. as well as <i>Alnus rhombifolius</i>.  In cases such as these, the web site is designed to show all possible species names that apply to a code if more than one exists (<a target=\"_blank\" href ui-sref=\"about.faq\">an ambiguous species code</a>).  In another example, the code R was often used to denote the presence of rock, although R is also the code for <i>Sequoia sempervirens</i>.  Many of these cases can be decided by the user just by the location of the entry on the datasheet.  For example, if R is recorded in the tree tally section and has dbh values, then it is most certainly referring to the tree and not to rock.</p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "		<p>Also, many species codes are different in slight but important ways which may have been overlooked by the data entry person or by the VTM field recorder.  If one letter or symbol of the code was incorrectly entered or recorded it could translate into a different species or an <a target=\"_blank\" href ui-sref=\"about.faq\">unidentified species code</a>.  For example, species codes for grasses were underlined.  During data entry those codes were entered with a 2 following the code to denote the underline.  If, for example, the data entry person did not notice that the code LP was underlined it would translate to <i>Pinus flexilis</i> (LP) instead of <i>Leptochloa sp</i>. (LP2).  Also, codes that depend on the case of the second letter can be problematic.  For instance, depending on the VTM recorder's handwriting it may be difficult to distinguish a lowercase l with the number 1, which again could lead to an incorrect translation from code to species name.  If the data entry person could not read the VTM field recorder's handwriting, the entry was entered as \"illegible\".</p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "		<p>Many entries recorded in the Vegetation Type section of the plot datasheets are not the same as the mapped vegetation type on the corresponding Vegetation Type Map.  Most of the time the vegetation type was recorded in words, like \"Sagebrush\", which is straightforward; but VTM field recorders often recorded the vegetation type instead as a string of species codes, like \"AtrGr2\", to denote the dominant species in the area.  Atr is code for <i>Artemisia tridentata</i> and Gr2 is code for <i>Grass</i>, so in this case the database would show <i>Artemisia tridentata</i> and <i>Grass</i> as the entry for this plot.   These species codes would have been later interpreted by VTM personnel to fall into one of the vegetation types and the plot would have been mapped accordingly.  However, if a user queries the Vegetation Type field of the database for all the Sagebrush vegetation type plots, only the plots that actually have the word \"Sagebrush\" in the Type field would be included in the query results, even though the \"<i>Artemisia tridentata</i> and Grass\" plot may have been mapped as a Sagebrush type.  </p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "		<p>The species code \"W\" or \"w\" is of special concern when it appears in the Vegetation Type field.  The lowercase w always follows an uppercase letter such as \"Dw\".  D is the code for Douglas fir (1930's name was <i>Pseudotsuga taxifolia</i>)*; and W is the code for <i>Quercus wislizenii</i>.  It appears that when used in the type field, W and w may sometimes refer to the species <i>Abies concolor</i> (species code W1).  We think this may be true because in some cases it is recorded in plots that 1) list W1 in the tree tally section and not W, and 2) these plots are also outside of the elevational range of <i>Quercus wislizenii</i>.  In other cases it does appear to code for <i>Quercus wislizenii</i>.  In either case, the database will translate W to <i>Quercus wislizenii</i> because we have found no documented source (no official VTM species list or other official VTM source) that W can also refer to <i>Abies concolor</i>.</p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "		<p>Our task was to provide what was written on the datasheets in a digital format.  The type field as it exists may not be the best way to answer research questions about vegetation types, since the type field data on the datasheets is often in a raw species list format.  The order of the species codes listed in this field was important in translating to a vegetation type (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/vtm/ucb/text/cubio_vtm_fm.pdf\">Manual of Field Instructions for Vegetation Type Map of California</a>), and this was done by VTM personnel for the preparation of the Vegetation Type Map.  Therefore, data from existing digitized Vegetation Type Maps (digitization is currently in progress) are the best source of classifying vegetation of particular plots using the VTM method of classification.</p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "		<p><small><sup>*</sup>D is the species code for <i>Quercus douglasii</i> in certain quadrangles, as is documented in quadrangle specific species lists.  When translating codes into species names, the database defers first to the quadrangle specific list if one exists, but not all quadrangles have their own species list.  All other codes come from global species lists, ie, official VTM species lists that are not particular to one specific quadrangle.</small></p>\n" +

    "		    <b>Illegible writing on datasheet</b>\n" +
    "		    <p>\n" +
    "		      In any field, if a word was not written legibly enough to understand, it was entered as \"(illegible word)\" (in parentheses or brackets) or \"illegible\", sometimes with a suggestion for what the word might mean.  For ex., if in the Excessive Erosion Evidence section the datasheet contained something like \"Shet erosion on hillsides\", where the \"Shet\" was written poorly enough that we could not even be certain that it was written as \"Shet\", the data enterer would enter \"(Illegible word, looks like \"Shet\") erosion on hillsides\" or \"(Illegible word, possibly \"Sheet\") erosion on hillsides\".  If the word was totally indecipherable the data enterer would enter \"(illegible word) erosion on hillsides\".\n" +

    "		  <li>\n" +
    "		    <b>Hyphens, blanks, and checkmarks</b>\n" +
    "		    <p>\n" +
    "		      In general, if a hyphen or checkmark was written on the datasheet it was entered as a hyphen (-) or, for checkmarks it was entered as \"check\" or \"checked\" or \"check mark\".  This rule is probably not entirely consistent, however.  Sections on the datasheet that were left blank, have a checkmark in them, or have a hyphen to indicate that no information was taken were sometimes left blank by the data enterers.\n" +
    "		    </p>\n" +
    "		  </li>\n" +
    "		  <li>\n" +
    "		    <b>Spelling errors</b>\n" +
    "		    <p>\n" +
    "		      If obvious spelling errors were found on datasheets (ie spelling errors made by VTM personnel) they were corrected during data entry. \n" +

    "		    <b>Blank datasheets and placeholder sheets</b>\n" +
    "		    <p>\n" +
    "		      All datasheets had a map number and plot number written on them, but some had very little or no other information recorded on them.  In these cases blank fields were left blank.  Sometimes instead of a datasheet a piece of paper (not a datasheet) had the map number and plot number and sometimes other remarks written on it, but no data.   We called these \"placeholders\", as they seemed to take the place of a  datasheet. They appear to be original VTM forms, because they are on the same type of paper and use the same typeset as other VTM datasheets.  We are not sure if these plots were ever sampled.  In any case, the data enterer entered all information written on the sheet.  The data enterer also noted in the Miscellaneous_Notes field that it was a placeholder sheet that did not have any data recorded on it.\n" +

    "		<p>The VTM plot maps show the locations of plots surveyed during the original VTM project.  The original surveyors ran vegetation transects at each plot, collecting species richness and abundance data for trees and ground cover.  The VTM plot maps mark the location of the plots with red numbered circles.  To our knowledge these circles were stamped, and thus their size has no meaning.</p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "		<h3>Naming Convenstions</h2>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "		<p>Each VTM plot map was divided into a grid, labeled alphabetically down the side and numerically across the top.  The plots were numbered within each section of the grid, for example A13 for grid section A 1, plot 3.  We assign each plot a unique identifier by prepending the quad number, i.e. 65A13 for quad 65, grid section A 1, plot 3.</p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "		<h3>Scanning</h3>\n" +
    "			<p>We scanned all VTM plot maps on an Epson Perfection flatbed scanner at 600 dpi.  We cropped and rotated the scans in Adobe Photoshop to prepare them for rectification.</p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "		<h3>Georeferencing</h3>\n" +
    "		<p>The original VTM surveyors marked the plot locations on USGS topographic maps, which have a polyconic projection centered at the center of the map (Birdseye 1928).  We first registered the historic uncut maps of the same vintage as the VTM cut maps to modern maps (1:24,000-scale USGS Digital Raster Graphic digital images of modern USGS quadrangles) of a known projection and coordinate system using stable tie points such as roads and peaks. We used between eight and 16 tie points per map. Next, the uncut scanned VTM maps were georeferenced to the georeferenced historic uncut maps using common map features as the tie points. We used a minimum of six tie points per segment and first order polynomial transformations for each step. Average RMSE for the process was around 60 m. All plot locations were digitized manually and their location attributed to the plot ID.</p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "		<h3>Error</h3>\n" +
    "		<p>Geospatial data is of little value without some knowledge of the spatial uncertainty or error associated with it, and this is especially true of historical geospatial data.  Spatial error in the VTM plot maps begins with the USGS topographic maps the original surveyors used to mark their plots.  We were unable to discover any USGS standards in spatial uncertainty prior to the <a href=\"http://rockyweb.cr.usgs.gov/nmpstds/nmas647.html\">National Map Accuracy Standards</a> (NMAS) of 1947, so we have assumed that maps produced before then are at most as accurate.  The USGS DRGs that we used as a reference when georeferencing the historical maps do follow the NMAS, and thus contribute about 20.32 m.</p>\n" +
    "		<p>The VTM surveyors also introduced uncertainty in marking their plots on the maps.  This is impossible to quantify since no one who might have remembered the locations of individual plots in the field is still alive.  Instead, we use the size of the red circle as a proxy.  We know that the size of the circle was not intended for this use, but we think it represents a maximum degree of error in the placement of the plot on the map.  We selected plots at random from the set of georeferenced maps in December of 2004, 20 from the 30' maps and 20 from 15' maps, and averaged the radii of their red circles.  15' plots had an average circle radius of 112.46 m, and 30' plots had an average circle radius of 215.73 m.</p>\n" +
    "		<p>The process of rectification also introduces error, but it does so in a quantifiable way.  We recorded the total root mean squared (RMS) error for each rectification event (each base map, each VTM plot section).  This was highly variable for the base maps, but amounted to about 2 pixels on average for the VTM plot sections.</p>\n" +
    "		<p>We gauged error in manually digitizing each plot point by testing technicians involved in the georeferencing process for their ability to place single pixel at the center of a circle 39 pixels in diameter, the approximate size of the plot circle on a scanned VTM plot section.  We measured the Euclidian distance of their point relative to the true center of the circle, averaged the error across technicians, and converted to meters for 30' and 15' maps.</p>\n" +
    "		<p>We combined all sources of error by taking root of the sum of the squared error from all sources, as per Thapa and Bossler 1992<sup><a href=\"#/about/plotmaps#ref2\">2</a></sup>.  Since each individual plot section has its own error, this means that all the plot points on a particular VTM plot section have the same error value.</p>\n" +

    "				<p>The VTM plot maps show the locations of all the individual plots surveyed by the original VTM crews. The points were stamped in red ink on USGS topographic maps that had been cut into eight or more segments, mounted on canvas, and folded, to facilitate use in the field. The plot map collection comprises fifteen minute (1:62500 scale) and thirty minute (1:125000 scale) quadrangles, primarily concentrated along the central and southern coastal ranges, and along the Sierras. In order to digitize this data set, all the plot maps were scanned at high resolution, one cut segment at a time. An uncut, scanned version of each map (of the same edition and reprint, when possible) was georeferenced to USGS Digital Raster Graphics (digital images of USGS quadrangles). The cut VTM segments were in turn rectified and registered to the uncut reference map, thereby brining them into a modern geographical coordinate system. The individual plot points were digitized as ESRI shapefiles, and the associated data wre entered into a database. Here you can download the raw original scans, the georeferenced VTM plot maps, the digitized plot locations, and the associated text data.</p>\n" +
    "				<p>Statewide there are approximately 18,000 VTM plots, concentrated along the central and southern coastal ranges, and along the Sierra Nevada. These plots were surveyed by the VTM field crews as a check on the vegetation polygons, and also to provide details on species composition, size and stand density of trees and shrubs and depth of leaf litter. The rectangular sample plots (800 m2 in forests, 400 m2 in scrub and chaparral communities) run upslope and were divided into milacre sampling units in which dominant species and height characteristics was recorded. Trees greater than 10 cm in dbh within 10 m of either side of the center-line were tallied by species and diameter class. In both forest and understory plots slope, soil characteristics and year of last burn was recorded. The plots cover a gradient of vegetation types and include data regarding tree stand structure (number per diameter class), percent cover of dominant overstory and understory vegetation by species, soil type, parent material, leaf litter, elevation, slope, aspect, parent material, and other environmental variables. All plot data was stored on paper data sheets, and individual plots were numbered according to U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic quadrangle map name, quad section number and plot number.

At sample plots, information on overstory and understory vegetation were collected. According to his reports, it took a two-man crew from six to eight weeks to complete the fieldwork for a 15-minute quad of about 6,070 ha.  The vegetation mapping scheme was driven by \"the dominant vegetation visible externally\", in other words, by overstory species recognition, and included \"mosaic types\" - complex vegetation conditions that resulted from fire or other disturbances, and pure and mixed stand conditions which they associated with \"natural plant associations\".  The mapped products include 215 maps with the major vegetation types shown in different colors and separated by ink lines. These are over printed in color on 7.5-minute, 15-minute, and 30-minute USGS topographic quadrangles.
