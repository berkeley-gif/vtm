	<h3>A Brief Summary of the Methods</h3>

	<p>There are approximately 3,100 black and white landscape and stand scale photographs (9.2 x 13.6 cm) from 1920â€“1941, many of which are keyed to USGS topographical maps with the location of the photographer is written in red pen on the maps, with an arrow marking the vantage point and view of the photo. The photograph captions typically includes a description of the location and subject of the photograph including relevant genus and species, timber stand conditions, and examples of cultivation, grazing, logging, mining and fire, and quad name. The photographer, date of the photograph, and occasionally township and range are included.</p> 

	<p>Each photograph was scanned, and information from captions were entered into a database that is searchable by keyword (information from photograph caption) and genus, species. The location of each photograph depicted on an accompanying map USGS topographic map were georeferenced. The protocol, developed by the Berkeley Museum for Vertebrate Zoology, involves measuring the distance and bearing of each marked point from the known southwest corner and calculating its location.</p>
