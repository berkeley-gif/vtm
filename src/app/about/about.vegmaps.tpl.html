	<h3>A Brief Summary of the Methods</h3>
	<p>Dominant vegetation type maps were mapped with a minimum mapping unit (MMU) of 16 ha by direct observation ‘from ridges, peaks, and other vantage points’’ (Wieslander 1935) in the field by VTM crews, directly upon 15-minute (1: 62,500-scale) topographic quadrangles, and supplemented by sample plots (which are described below) (Wieslander 1935). According to his reports, it took a two-man crew from six to eight weeks to complete the fieldwork for a 15-minute quad of about 6,070 ha (Wieslander 1935).  The vegetation mapping scheme was driven by ‘‘the dominant vegetation visible externally’’ (Wieslander 1935), in other words, by overstory species recognition, and included ‘‘mosaic types’’ - complex vegetation conditions that resulted from fire or other disturbances, and pure and mixed stand conditions which they associated with “natural plant associations” (Wieslander 1935).</p>

	<p>The VTM vegetation maps were mostly found in the Marian Koshland Library archives, although the collection was also distributed in various labs and libraries around the state.  As many of the maps as could be found were gathered and brought to UC Davis for digitization by Dr. James Thorne.  The VTM vegetation maps were scanned at 300 dpi, one cut segment at a time, and the scanned versions of the VTM tiles corresponding to each topographic map were then registered to the topographic base map. Once the VTM images were georeferenced, vegetation polygons were traced and plant species codes in each polygon were transcribed. The original VTM plant species codes were linked to modern plant scientific names, and the sequence of species in each polygon was assigned to vegetation and habitat types. The project used the Manual of California Vegetation Types (Sawyer and Keeler‐Wolf 1995), and the California Wildlife Habitat Relationships Models (WHR) (California Department of Fish and Game 2004) for land cover classifications. Once these attributes were added to the maps, they were then error‐checked and finalized.</p>
