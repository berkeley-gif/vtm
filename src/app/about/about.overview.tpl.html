		<p>In the 1930s, forester A. E. Wieslander spearheaded a U. S. Forest Service survey of California vegetation, called the Vegetation Type Mapping Project (VTM).  In this remarkable effort the Forest Service crews mapped over 1/3 (16 million+ hectares) of the state. Because of its comprehensive and detailed nature, the VTM dataset is recognized as a valuable window into the state of early 20th century California flora. The collection has provided data for numerous graduate theses at several Universities, as well as numerous manuscripts in peer-reviewed journals.</p>

        <p><blockquote>The Wieslander Vegetation Type Mapping collection has been described as &ldquo;the most important and comprehensive botanical map of a large area ever undertaken anywhere on the earth&rsquo;s surface&rdquo;.<small>Jepson et al. 2000</small></blockquote></p>         

		<p>The ultimate goal of the original VTM project was to create vegetation type maps, but several other types of data were collected in the process.  Vegetation plots, in which crews collected data on species composition, depth of leaf litter, tree size, and other variable, were used to validate the broad zones of vegetation they designated from high vantage points. The plot locations were marked on USGS topographic quadrats for reference. Additionally, sample specimens were collected and placed in the University Herbarium (now the Jepson Herbarium), many of which remain there today. Photographs of many distinct locations were taken, the locations of which were also recorded on topographic quads (unfortunately many of the original photos maps were lost). Finally, they created vegetation maps, drawing broad zones of single or mixed stands in colored pencil directly onto USGS topographic quads.</p>

		<p>The project was originally designed to include detailed vegetation type maps of 220 USGS quadrangles, but the survey was halted by World War II, and only 23 maps were published. The project continued after the war under state funding, but no more quads were ever published. However, much of the unpublished data survived and currently exists in storage at the University of California, Berkeley, and other map libraries and research labs around California. (Wieslander 1961, Colwell 1977)</p>

		<p>Due to the dataset's physical fragility it has been largely inaccessible to the broader scientific community. Therefore, researchers at <a href="http://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu">U. C. Berkeley Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management (ESPM)</a>, in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/BIOS/">Marian Koshland Bioscience and Natural Resources Library</a>, sought funding to digitize all of the published and unpublished data to facilitate a broad distribution and to further its use in modern geographic information systems.</p>

        <p>The VTM collection - vegetation maps, plot data, plot maps, and photographs were compiled, digitized, and are now being served as a complete collection via the new UC Berkeley <a href="http://holos.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">HOLOS ecoengine</a>. The digitization of the parts of the collection was a multi-lab effort. The VTM photo digitization was led by the <a href="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/BIOS/" target="_blank">Marian Koshland Bioscience and Natural Resources Library</a>, and is complete. The <a href="http://kellylab.berkeley.edu/">Kelly Lab</a> in ESPM led the plot map digitization and georeferencing. The <a href="http://nature.berkeley.edu/allen-diazlab/" target="_blank">Allen-Diaz Lab</a> in ESPM led the entering all of the plot data, which the original surveyors recorded by hand, in the field, on thin sheets of paper in faint pencil. Researchers at the <a href="http://ice.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">Information Center for the Environment</a> at U. C. Davis led the digitization of all the unpublished vegetation maps.</p>
