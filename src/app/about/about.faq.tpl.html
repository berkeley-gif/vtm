		<h2>What is an "Unmatched species code"?</h2>
		<p>An "Unmatched species code" refers to a code that we haven't been able to associate with a species.  When the original VTM surveyors recorded their data, they used 1-3 letter codes to refer to different species.  They listed most of these codes and their corresponding species in the VTM field manual, or along with the original data sheets, but not all of them.  Sometimes they also recorded irregular codes, or made typos, neither of which match to a species given the listings in the manual.</p>
		<h2>What is an "Ambiguous species code"?</h2>
		<p>An "Ambiguous species code" refers to a code that could refer to multiple different species.  Sometimes the original surveyors used the same code to refer to different species when they were working in different places.  Several of the species code crosswalks they left behind are quad specific, so if a code means one thing in the Napa quad and another in the Placerville quad, we can distinguish them.  However, several ambiguous codes are not quad specific, so given an ambiguous code in an area where none of the quad-specific crosswalks apply, we just report all the species to which the code could refer.</p>
		<h2>What do you mean by "<em>Probable</em> Species"?</h2>
		<p>Given the above complications in translating the species codes to full species names, and the errors inherent in the original data and those contributed by modern data entry,  we don't consider all our translations to be completely accurate.  Next to each name, you should see a link that will pop up a window showing you all the code-to-species matches from the various translation tables included in the original VTM data.</p>
		<h2>How do you translate the species codes to actual species names?</h2>
		<p>The VTM data come with several lists of occasionally contradictory code-to-species translations, covering different areas of the state.</p>

		<h2>Why do some species appear in areas where they couldn't possibly have been found?</h2>
		
		<p>As mentioned above, some species codes are ambiguous, and we do our best to report that ambiguity when it occurs.  There is also some error in the data, originating both from the original surveyors and from the modern digitization effort.  We have made no attempt to correct potentially erroneous codes in the original data, but we have reported the levels of modern data entry errors in the <a href ui-sref="about.plotdata">description of the plot data</a>.</p>
		<h2>Do you plan to provide scans of the original plot datasheets?</h2>
		<p>We are very interested in providing scans of the original datasheets on this site, but currently (as of May 2006) lack the appropriate funding.</p>
