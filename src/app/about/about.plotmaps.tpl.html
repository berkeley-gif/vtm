		<h1>About the VTM Plot Maps and Plot Points</h1>
				
		<p>The VTM plot maps show the locations of plots surveyed during the original VTM project.  The original surveyors ran vegetation transects at each plot, collecting species richness and abundance data for trees and ground cover.  The VTM plot maps mark the location of the plots with red numbered circles.  To our knowledge these circles were stamped, and thus their size has no meaning.</p>

		<h2>NAMING CONVENTIONS</h2>

		<p>Each VTM plot map was divided into a grid, labeled alphabetically down the side and numerically across the top.  The plots were numbered within each section of the grid, for example A13 for grid section A 1, plot 3.  We assign each plot a unique identifier by prepending the quad number, i.e. 65A13 for quad 65, grid section A 1, plot 3.</p>

		<h2>SCANNING</h2>
			<p>We scanned all VTM plot maps on an Epson Perfection flatbed scanner at 600 dpi.  We cropped and rotated the scans in Adobe Photoshop to prepare them for rectification.</p>

		<h2>GEOREFERENCING</h2>
		<p>The original VTM surveyors marked the plot locations on USGS topographic maps, which have a polyconic projection centered at the center of the map (Birdseye 1928).  We first registered the historic uncut maps of the same vintage as the VTM cut maps to modern maps (1:24,000-scale USGS Digital Raster Graphic digital images of modern USGS quadrangles) of a known projection and coordinate system using stable tie points such as roads and peaks. We used between eight and 16 tie points per map. Next, the uncut scanned VTM maps were georeferenced to the georeferenced historic uncut maps using common map features as the tie points. We used a minimum of six tie points per segment and first order polynomial transformations for each step. Average RMSE for the process was around 60 m. All plot locations were digitized manually and their location attributed to the plot ID.</p>

		<h2>ERROR</h2>
		<p>Geospatial data is of little value without some knowledge of the spatial uncertainty or error associated with it, and this is especially true of historical geospatial data.  Spatial error in the VTM plot maps begins with the USGS topographic maps the original surveyors used to mark their plots.  We were unable to discover any USGS standards in spatial uncertainty prior to the <a href="http://rockyweb.cr.usgs.gov/nmpstds/nmas647.html">National Map Accuracy Standards</a> (NMAS) of 1947, so we have assumed that maps produced before then are at most as accurate.  The USGS DRGs that we used as a reference when georeferencing the historical maps do follow the NMAS, and thus contribute about 20.32 m.</p>
		<p>The VTM surveyors also introduced uncertainty in marking their plots on the maps.  This is impossible to quantify since no one who might have remembered the locations of individual plots in the field is still alive.  Instead, we use the size of the red circle as a proxy.  We know that the size of the circle was not intended for this use, but we think it represents a maximum degree of error in the placement of the plot on the map.  We selected plots at random from the set of georeferenced maps in December of 2004, 20 from the 30' maps and 20 from 15' maps, and averaged the radii of their red circles.  15' plots had an average circle radius of 112.46 m, and 30' plots had an average circle radius of 215.73 m.</p>
		<p>The process of rectification also introduces error, but it does so in a quantifiable way.  We recorded the total root mean squared (RMS) error for each rectification event (each base map, each VTM plot section).  This was highly variable for the base maps, but amounted to about 2 pixels on average for the VTM plot sections.</p>
		<p>We gauged error in manually digitizing each plot point by testing technicians involved in the georeferencing process for their ability to place single pixel at the center of a circle 39 pixels in diameter, the approximate size of the plot circle on a scanned VTM plot section.  We measured the Euclidian distance of their point relative to the true center of the circle, averaged the error across technicians, and converted to meters for 30' and 15' maps.</p>
		<p>We combined all sources of error by taking root of the sum of the squared error from all sources, as per Thapa and Bossler 1992<sup><a href="#/about/plotmaps#ref2">2</a></sup>.  Since each individual plot section has its own error, this means that all the plot points on a particular VTM plot section have the same error value.</p>
