        <h2>General information</h2>
		<p>Statewide there are approximately 18,000 VTM plots, concentrated along the central and southern coastal ranges, and along the Sierra Nevada. These plots were surveyed by the VTM field crews as a check on the vegetation polygons, and also to provide details on species composition, size and stand density of trees and shrubs and depth of leaf litter.  The rectangular sample plots (800 m<sup>2</sup> in forests, 400 m<sup>2</sup> in scrub and chaparral communities) run upslope and were divided into milacre sampling units in which dominant species and height characteristics was recorded. Trees greater than 10 cm in dbh within 10 m of either side of the center-line were tallied by species and diameter class. In both forest and understory plots slope, soil characteristics and year of last burn was recorded. The plots cover a gradient of vegetation types and include data regarding tree stand structure (number per diameter class), percent cover of dominant overstory and understory vegetation by species, soil type, parent material, leaf litter, elevation, slope, aspect, parent material, and other environmental variables.  All plot data was stored on paper data sheets, and individual plots were numbered according to U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic quadrangle map name, quad section number and plot number. For more information on the plots, please see: Kelly et al. 2005 Madro&ntilde;o article on the <a ng-href="#/about/publications">Publications</a> page.</p>
