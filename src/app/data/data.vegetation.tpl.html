                <p>Dominant vegetation type maps were mapped with a minimum mapping unit of 16 ha by direct observation "from ridges, peaks, and other vantage points" in the field by VTM crews, directly upon 15-minute (1: 62,500-scale) topographic quadrangles, and supplemented by sample plots. At sample plots, information on overstory and understory vegetation were collected. According to his reports, it took a two-man crew from six to eight weeks to complete the fieldwork for a 15-minute quad of about 6,070 ha.  The vegetation mapping scheme was driven by "the dominant vegetation visible externally", in other words, by overstory species recognition, and included "mosaic types" - complex vegetation conditions that resulted from fire or other disturbances, and pure and mixed stand conditions which they associated with "natural plant associations".  The mapped products include 215 maps with the major vegetation types shown in different colors and separated by ink lines. These are over printed in color on 7.5-minute, 15-minute, and 30-minute USGS topographic quadrangles.
