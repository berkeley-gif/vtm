		  Using the HOLOS API
		</h3>
		<p>Parts of the VTM collection have been used in scientific research since the mid 1940’s, however the data and their utility continue to expand. The vegetation maps have been used to understand legacies of land use change and plan for the future on broad scales. The plot data have been used to examine changes to chaparral and forest communities around the state by relocating and resurveying plots as well as by comparing modern vegetation plot data to predict changes in community structure under a changing climate. Some of the photographs have been reshot, and used to understand changing vegetation structure.</p>
		<p>The VTM website is currently hosted under the frame of the Berkeley Ecoinformatics Engine (Holos) (<a href="https://ecoengine.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">https://ecoengine.berkeley.edu/</a>), built with open source software and using a RESTful API structure, this engine encourages further data synthesis by making available a wide variety of data sources, both historical and contemporary. The Berkeley Ecoinformatics Engine serves much of the ecological data collected at UC Berkeley, among them about 5,000,000 million records from museum specimen, soil and pollen data, field station records, sensor readings, as well as biophysical base layers such as climate and land use.</p>
		<p>We recommend downloading the data in full to work with, but researchers can also interact with the data through the HOLOS API (<a href="https://ecoengine.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">https://ecoengine.berkeley.edu/</a>).  If the data is used in research, we ask that you cite this article: Kelly, M., B. Allen-Diaz, and N. Kobzina. 2005.
